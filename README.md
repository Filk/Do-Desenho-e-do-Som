# Do Desenho e do Som

Do Desenho e do Som is a digital application to generate and control animated scores in real time. The most interesting feature about working with real-time graphical scores is the possibility to “compose” music in real time with some amount of control and expectations. In such systems I find compeling to be able to induce musical gestures, rhythm flow and consequently shape the form of the piece in real time. With Do Desenho e do Som one can perform real-time stochastic music, mediated by real-time generated screen scores.
The typical setup consists of one computer to control/generate the scores (usually manipulated by one person), up to four computers to display screen-scores for musicians and one more person playing electronic music. Nonetheless, having or not electronic music is a matter of choice. 

ASSISTANT
The assistant interface provides the ability to generate individual graphics for each screen-score. The purpose of the assistant is to chose and manipulate the panels and their attributes for each screen-score 

SCORES
Each performer has a screen-score being generated and controlled by the assistant. Each graphical animation is defined as a panel and the assistant can choose one at a time. Panel possibilites are: Pong, Balls, Cells, Shake, Drawing, Solo, Silence and End.
